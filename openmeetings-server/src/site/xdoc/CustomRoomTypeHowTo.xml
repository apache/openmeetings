		<section name="Why creating a custom room type in OpenMeetings">
			<p>If you want to create your own styled room the best thing to do in
				order to be "update-save" is to create your own custom room type. There is an empty configuration
				by default shipped with every release of OpenMeetings, the room type "custom" (ID = 5).<br/>
				<br/>
				You can use that and extend it, or you can add more room types to fit your use case.
			</p>
			<p></p>
		</section>
		<section name="Create your own room type class (User Interface)">
			<p>Lets start by creating your custom room type class.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Additional room type need to be added to <code>https://github.com/apache/openmeetings/blob/master/openmeetings-db/src/main/java/org/apache/openmeetings/db/entity/room/Room.java</code>
					class <code>Type</code> enum
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>(Optional)</strong>
					<code>https://github.com/apache/openmeetings/blob/master/openmeetings-web/src/main/java/org/apache/openmeetings/web/room/RoomPanel.java</code>
					java class need to be extended and customized
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>(Alternatively)</strong> room sub-components can be extended and customized as it currently done for
					<code>https://github.com/apache/openmeetings/blob/master/openmeetings-web/src/main/java/org/apache/openmeetings/web/room/wb/InterviewWbPanel.java</code>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Step 2) above is marked (Optional) since in most cases in might be enough to customize CSS rules for newly created room type<br/>
				i.e. each room type can be customized by specifying CSS rules for this room type only. to do it:
				<ul>
					<li>
						create CSS rule starting <code>.room-block .container.custom</code> where <code>custom</code> is the room type<br/>
						for ex.
						<source>
<![CDATA[
.room-block .container.presentation .menu {
	background-color: red;
}
]]>
						</source>
						Will set <code>background-color</code> for room menu in all rooms of type <code>presentation</code>
					</li>
					<li>continue styling :)))</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Thats it. You can add/edit/delete your room with the new room type in the Administration > Rooms interface of
				OpenMeetings like any other room.</p>
