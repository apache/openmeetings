			<p>
				Time zones are being taken from JDK, so please keep it up to date :)
			</p>
			<p>
				You can set a Flag
				<strong>forceTimeZoneCheck</strong>
				for each user that gives him a Pop-Up notification to change his
				time zone. The Flag can be changed in the user administration of
				OpenMeetings. This can be handy if you update from a previous
				version of OpenMeetings to make sure users see the new feature and
				update their settings.
