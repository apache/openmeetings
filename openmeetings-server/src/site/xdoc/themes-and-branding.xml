			<p>To modify default theme used by OM please open following file in the SVN: </p>
			<p>
				<a
					href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openmeetings/application/trunk/openmeetings-web/src/main/webapp/css/theme_om/jquery-ui.css"
					target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openmeetings/application/trunk/openmeetings-web/src/main/webapp/css/theme_om/jquery-ui.css
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>and follow to link following "To view and modify this theme, visit" text in css comments</p>
			<p>
				Or if you already installed OpenMeetings on your machine at:
				<br />
				<tt>/webapps/openmeetings/css/theme_om/jquery-ui.css</tt>
				<br />
				The file contains border, background and font color definitions as
				well as paths to icons that are loaded at runtime.
				<br />
				You can change the theme at runtime and just reload the browser
				(eventually clear the browser cache) to see updates based on
				modification in your theme.
			</p>
			<p>All other elements might be styled by modifying CSS files in <tt>/webapps/openmeetings/css</tt> folder</p>
