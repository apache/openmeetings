		<section name="CVE-2016-0783 - Predictable password reset token">
			<p>Severity: Critical</p>
			<p>Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation</p>
			<p>Versions Affected: Apache OpenMeetings 1.9.x - 3.1.0</p>
			<p>Description: The hash generated by the external password reset function is generated by concatenating the user
				name and the current system time, and then hashing it using MD5. This is highly predictable and
				can be cracked in seconds by an attacker with knowledge of the user name of an OpenMeetings
				user.<br/>

		<section name="CVE-2016-0784 - ZIP file path traversal">
			<p>Severity: Moderate</p>
			<p>Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation</p>
			<p>Versions Affected: Apache OpenMeetings 1.9.x - 3.1.0</p>
			<p>Description: The Import/Export System Backups functionality in the OpenMeetings Administration menu
				(http://domain:5080/openmeetings/#admin/backup) is vulnerable to path traversal via specially
				crafted file names within ZIP archives. By uploading an archive containing a file named
				../../../public/hello.txt will write the file “hello.txt” to the http://domain:5080/openmeetings/public/
				directory. This could be used to, for example, overwrite the /usr/bin/convert file (or any other 3 rd
				party integrated executable) with a shell script, which would be executed the next time an image file
				is uploaded and imagemagick is invoked.<br/>

		<section name="CVE-2016-2163 - Stored Cross Site Scripting in Event description">
			<p>Severity: Moderate</p>
			<p>Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation</p>
			<p>Versions Affected: Apache OpenMeetings 1.9.x - 3.0.7</p>
			<p>Description: When creating an event, it is possible to create clickable URL links in the event description. These
				links will be present inside the event details once a participant enters the room via the event. It is
				possible to create a link like "javascript:alert('xss')", which will execute once the link is clicked. As
				the link is placed within an &lt;a&gt; tag, the actual link is not visible to the end user which makes it hard
				to tell if the link is legit or not.<br/>

		<section name="CVE-2016-2164 - Arbitrary file read via SOAP API">
			<p>Severity: Critical</p>
			<p>Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation</p>
			<p>Versions Affected: Apache OpenMeetings 1.9.x - 3.0.7</p>
			<p>Description: When attempting to upload a file via the API using the importFileByInternalUserId or importFile
				methods in the FileService, it is possible to read arbitrary files from the system. This is due to that
				Java's URL class is used without checking what protocol handler is specified in the API call.<br/>
