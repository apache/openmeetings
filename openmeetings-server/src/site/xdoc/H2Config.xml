			<p>
				OpenMeetings default configuration is to use H2.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is recommended for production environments and high
				availibility to change to an usual relational database like Oracle, MySQL,
				Postgres, MSSQL or DB2.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more information about H2 see
				<a href="https://www.h2database.com">https://www.h2database.com</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a sample configuration for H2 that ships with
				every release in:
				<br />
				/webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/h2_persistence.xml
			</p>
			<p>
				If you encounter issues, you can drop the db and then run the web
				based installer again
