				All language string should be localized and stored in the language
				section. You have a full featured language editor with every
				installation of OpenMeetings, check out the
				<a href="LanguageEditor.html">LanguageEditor</a>

				To lookup the labelids in the GUI you can simply run OpenMeetings
				client with the debug enabled. That way every text-string has the
				labelid in brackets additionally in the textfield. To start the
				client in debug mode please check "Tips and Tricks" section of

						modifying "subject" fragment in file
