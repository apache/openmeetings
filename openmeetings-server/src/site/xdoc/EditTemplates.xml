				All language string should be localized and stored in the language
				section. You have a full featured language editor with every
				installation of OpenMeetings, check out the
				<a href="LanguageEditor.html">LanguageEditor</a>
				.

			<p>
				To lookup the labelids in the GUI you can simply run OpenMeetings
				client with the debug enabled. That way every text-string has the
				labelid in brackets additionally in the textfield. To start the
				client in debug mode please check "Tips and Tricks" section of
				<a href="installation.html" rel="nofollow">Installation guide</a>

		<section name="Changing layout, adding footers in emails">
			<p>If you would like to change the standard email layout or add for
				example some footer in every email you have to change the email
				templates.
			</p>
			<div>To do that:
				<ul>
					<li>Stop the OpenMeetings service</li>
					<li>Goto: <code>$OM_HOME/webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/classes/org/apache/openmeetings/service/mail/template/</code></li>
					<li>Change HTML file(s) according to your needs, BUT do not remove
						elements with <code>wicket:id</code> attributes! You can hide those
						elements by adding <code>wicket:visible="false"</code> attribute
					</li>
					<li>Starting OM 3.1.4 you can change Appointment reminder subject by
						modifying "subject" fragment in file
						<code>$OM_HOME/webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/classes/org/apache/openmeetings/service/mail/template/subject/AbstractSubjectEmailTemplate.html</code>
						as described in previous bullet.
					</li>
