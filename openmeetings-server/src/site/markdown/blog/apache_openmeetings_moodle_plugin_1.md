The plugin enables integration of Apache OpenMeetings Incubating <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openmeetings/" target="_BLANK">http://incubator.apache.org/openmeetings/</a>) conference rooms in the popular e-learning LMS Moodle (<a href="http://www.moodle.org" target="_BLANK">http://www.moodle.org</a>).
<br/><br/>
<b>Add virtual conference rooms to courses</b> Moodle organizes learning units in courses. The plugin enables teachers/course moderators of Moodle to add new conference rooms to courses.
<br/><br/>
<b>Single sign-on and Role-based access control</b> When the user enters the conference room via Moodle he does not need to re-login again. The plugin also transfers the role from Moodle to the conference room so that a teacher, admin or course moderator is automatically a moderator in the conference room.
<br/><br/>
<b>Enhancements for teachers and workgroups</b> In the plugin configuration you can choose if students that access the conference room need to wait till a teacher enters the room or can directly start.
<br/><br/>
<b>Integration of recordings</b> Instead of conference rooms you can also integrate conference recordings in Moodle. A recording can be any past conference session that youâ€™ve recorded with OpenMeetings. Students can then watch the recording streamed from the server. Additionally teachers, course moderators and admins can download it.
<br/><br/>
<b>Installation and documentation</b> can be found at:<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openmeetings/MoodlePlugin.html" target="_BLANK">http://incubator.apache.org/openmeetings/MoodlePlugin.html</a>
