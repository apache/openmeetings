# OpenMeetings v6.1.0 - WebRTC stability

v6.1.0 is a maintenance release and provides fixes to webRTC components for conference rooms. As well as fixes for UI and browser compatibility. OpenMeetings recently migrated all audio/video components to use HTML5 only (since v5.0.0), it is recommended to keep up to date with latest versions to keep up to date with improvements that browsers support for streaming video.
