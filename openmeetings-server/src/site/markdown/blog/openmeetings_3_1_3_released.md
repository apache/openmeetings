# OpenMeetings 3.1.3 released

Release v3.1.3 contains 21 enhancements and fixes. The main improvement of this release is to fix the RTMP-Streaming over SSL in both possible modes. The two available modes are:
<ul>
  <li>Native RTMPs</li>
  <li>RTMP Tunnelled over HTTPS (which is similar to RTMPT)</li>
</ul>

<b>Note</b> With this release Java8 is required, for the server as well as in case you are screen sharing.<br/>
<br/>
We recommend that previous releases will be upgrade to this version.<br/>
Other fixes in this version concern localisation, backup/restore, screen-sharing and sending invitations to conference rooms.<br/>
