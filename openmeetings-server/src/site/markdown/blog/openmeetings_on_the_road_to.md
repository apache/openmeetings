# OpenMeetings on the road to graduate from Incubator

We are happy to announce that the vote was successful to graduate OpenMeetings from the Incubator,
the result of the vote can be seen here <a href="http://markmail.org/message/zlu2jc23ls4hopjo" target="_BLANK">http://markmail.org/message/zlu2jc23ls4hopjo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The next Board meeting will be at the 19th December of 2012, we will submit our resolution and hopefully the Board will follow the recommendation from the Incubator to establish Apache OpenMeetings as top level project!<br/>
<br/>
However, as we are still an Incubator project we did submit also a quarterly update of our project.<br/>
<br/>
Project and community status:
<ul>
<li>Roadmap for OpenMeetings 2.1 and 3.0 has been discussed <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ugazdo4xgclakrib" target="_BLANK">http://markmail.org/message/ugazdo4xgclakrib</a> Version 3.0 is mainly about a HTML5 version of OpenMeetings. Discussion  resolution was to choose Wicket as basic JavaScript framework and  jQuery for pure client side tasks. By now we did already implement an  HTML5 interface for the administration section. Discussion which  approaches to use for the actual conferencing part is still ongoing</li>
<li>A testing application for AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation, build into Flash Player 11.2) was implemented and is in review <a href="http://markmail.org/message/g2zdwuruu7vuizvg" target="_BLANK">http://markmail.org/message/g2zdwuruu7vuizvg</a> </li>
