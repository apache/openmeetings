Version 3.2.1 of OpenMeetings changes the UI to use a mixed mode HTML5 and is part of the roadmap to a full HTML5 Web-Conferencing client.<br/>
<br/>
The new features in HTML5 include:
<ul>
<li>Room menu</li>
<li>User list</li>
<li>File management</li>
<li>Activities and actions</li>
<li>Room chat</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The remaining part using the Flash plugin is the whiteboard and Audio/Video.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally v3.2.1 improves some of the video streaming, upload and handling of documents in the whiteboard and enhancements around the chat and calendar.<br/>
