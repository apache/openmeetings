			<p>Manual balancing supposes that each room and user belongs to
				particular OpenMeetings server in the cluster.</p>
			<p>One database is used for all the OpenMeetings servers, so there is
				one user table and one conference room table there. Room and User tables has
				additional field named “server” – OpenMeetings server on which the
				conferences in this room would happen is stored there.</p>
			<p>Certain folders should be shared between all servers to allow access
				to the files/recording</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Configuration">
			<ul>
				<li>
					Multiple OM servers should be set up as described in
					<a href="installation.html" target="_BLANK">
						<b>Installation</b>
					</a>
				</li>
				<li>All servers should be configured to have same Time zone (To avoid
					Schedulers to drop user sessions as outdated)
				</li>
				<li>All servers should be configured to use the same DB</li>
				<li>Servers should be added in Administration->Servers section
				</li>
				<li>Servers should be assigned to the Users/Rooms in the
					Administration->Users and Administration->Conference Rooms sections
					correspondingly
				</li>
				<li>
					Consider all servers are installed into
					<div class="xmlcode">/opt/red5</div>
					then the folders
					<div class="xmlcode">/opt/red5/webapps/openmeetings/upload</div>
					and
					<div class="xmlcode">/opt/red5/webapps/openmeetings/streams</div>
					should be mounted to the same physical folders (using SAMBA or NFS)
