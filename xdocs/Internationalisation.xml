		<section name="Where to find language files">

			<p>You can find all current language files here: </p>
			<p>
				<a
					href="http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/singlewebapp/WebContent/languages/"
					rel="nofollow">http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/singlewebapp/WebContent/languages/
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>Just take one file and translate it to your language. </p>
		</section>

		<section name="Import and export of Language Files">

			<ul>
				<li>
					Use the
					<a href="LanguageEditor.html">LanguageEditor</a>
					for translation
				</li>
				<li>
					with the
					<a href="LanguageEditor.html">LanguageEditor</a>
					you can import and export Language Files
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section name="How to add it as installation option">
			<p>
				Once you have finished the translation you can add a new node to:
				<a
					href="http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/singlewebapp/WebContent/languages/languages.xml"
					rel="nofollow">http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/singlewebapp/WebContent/languages/languages.xml
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>the name of the language should match the name of the file. Once
				this is done the Language file will automatically be imported during
				installation and will be an option at login.
			</p>
