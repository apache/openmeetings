					<li>Make sure that you have set utf8 as default/server-character-set 
					</li>
					<li>
						make sure Postgres is listening on TCP/IP connections!
						<br />
						To verify if Postgres connection is working: OpenMeetings will
						automatically create all tables in the database and all tables
						should have utf8 as encoding/collation!
					</li>
					<li>If you encounter issues, you can drop the db again and delete
						the file $red5/webapps/openmeetings/conf/install.xml and then run
						the web based installer again
					</li>
