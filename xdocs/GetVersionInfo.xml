		<section name="How to check which Openmeetings version running">
			<p>If you need to know what version of OpenMeetings you are running,
				you can check that by the file: openmeetings.jar
			</p>
			<p>
				Unzip: /webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/lib/openmeetings.jar (jars are
				zips)
				<br />
				<br />
				In the resulting unziped folder open the file to read:
				/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
			</p>
			<p>You get something like this: </p>
			<div class="xmlcode">
				Manifest-Version: 1.0
				<br />
				Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.8.2
				<br />
				Created-By: 1.6.0_26-b03-383-11A511 (Apple Inc.)
				<br />
				Built-By: OpenMeetings - http://openmeetings.googlecode.com
				<br />
				Built-On: 23-October-2011
				<br />
				Svn-Revision: 4368
				<br />
			</div>
			<p>This version info is available since version 1.8.0. If you have an
				older version as version 1.8.0 then you might simply check the
				language files and the labelid in there, the numbers of labels are
				almost always unique in the versions. </p>
