			<p>
				You can use custom Crypt-Types, but you should decide during
				installation which Type of encryption you want to use. By default
				two type are available:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>org.xmlcrm.utils.crypt.MD5Implementation - this uses common MD5
					Crypt like PHP does, this is the default one (results in something
					like: fe01ce2a7fbac8fafaed7c982a04e229)</li>
				<li>org.xmlcrm.utils.crypt.MD5CryptImplementation - does use
					BSD-Style of encryption using a salt (results in something like:
					$1$GMsj7F2I$5S3r9CeukXGXNwf6b4sph1)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You can edit the config-key during Installation or later in the
				Administration Panel. But if you change it using the
				Administration-Panel previous passwords might be not working anymore
				as they are encrypted with another algorithm.

			<p>
				To add your own crypt style you need to write a class which
				implements the interface: org.xmlcrm.utils.cryptCryptString
				<br />
				and extends the Adapter: org.xmlcrm.utils.CryptStringAdapter
				<br />
				Example of an Implementation:
			</p>
			<div class="xmlcode">
				package org.xmlcrm.utils.crypt;
				
				import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
				
				public class MD5Implementation extends CryptStringAdapter implements CryptString {
				
				        @Override
				        public String createPassPhrase(String userGivenPass) {
				                String passPhrase = null;
				                try {
				                        passPhrase = MD5.do_checksum(userGivenPass);
				                } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
				                        e.printStackTrace();
				                }
				                return passPhrase;
				        }
				
				        @Override
				        public Boolean verifyPassword(String passGiven, String passwdFromDb) {
				                return (passwdFromDb.equals(createPassPhrase(passGiven)));
				        }
				        
				}
			</div>
			<p>To add your own Encryption-Class you need to add your class to the
				OpenMeetings-Webapp (make it available to the webapp-classpath) and
				use your custom-class-name instead of
				org.xmlcrm.utils.crypt.MD5Implementation during the Installation or
				at runtime by editing the config-key crypt_ClassName</p>
