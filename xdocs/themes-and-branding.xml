			<p>
				Themes are only available starting with Openmeetings 2.x.
				<br />
				There are also more general client side configuration like port
				configuration. Those configs are stored in the config.xml, see for
				example
				<a href="BrandingAndColors.html">BrandingAndColors.html</a>

		<section name="Editing the theme">

			<p>You can find the default theme in the SVN: </p>
			<p>
				<a
					href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openmeetings/trunk/singlewebapp/WebContent/openmeetings/default-theme.xml"
					target="_BLANK" rel="nofollow">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openmeetings/trunk/singlewebapp/WebContent/openmeetings/default-theme.xml
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Or if you already installed OpenMeetings on your machine at:
				<br />
				<tt>/webapps/openmeetings/default-theme.xml</tt>
				<br />
				The file contains border, background and font color definitions as
				well as paths to icons that are loaded at runtime.
				<br />
				You can change the theme at runtime and just reload the browser
				(eventually clear the browser cache) to see updates based on
				modification in your theme.
