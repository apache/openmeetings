            <!--- The <view> is the most basic viewable element in an OpenLaszlo application. Anything that is displayed on the canvas is a view or extends the view class. A view is a rectangle, which can be visible or invisible, and which can contain other views or display "resources" such as images, .swf files, or other supported media. One view controls one displayable resource. The view system is strictly hierarchical; that is, each view has a single parent but can have multiple children.  -->

Setting a view's 'donttrackplay' option to true will allow the view's resource to play without updating the value of the view's frame property.

	<!---	A CSS declaration of property: value pairs of layout attributes, which are used to create a layout that is attached to this view. If there is a class property, it names the class of the layout to be created, otherwise <simplelayout> is used.
