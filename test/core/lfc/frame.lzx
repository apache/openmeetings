<!---
A frame of a multi-frame resource.

The <frame> tag is used to define a single frame of a multi-frame <resource>. A multi-frame resource contains several images which can be toggled among by script commands.

Multiple frame tags can be declared consecutively to produce a single resource constructed of an unlimited number of frames. Such composed resources are often used to conveniently implement mouse rollovers, button states, or other UI elements where alternate views of a resource are required. Once a multi-frame resource has been defined and presented within a <view>, the developer can designate which frame is actively visible through the use of the view's setResourceNumber method.

Multi-frame resources can be used in conjunction with components such as <basebutton>, which pre-define complex button behavior using frames designated by the user.
