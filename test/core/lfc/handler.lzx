<!-- The receiver in Laszlo's point-to-point event system.
A delegate is an object that calls a specific method on a specific object when its execute method is called. It is essentially a method closure.

Delegates, along with <event>, comprise Laszlo's point to point event system. A delegate represents a named method of an object. Delegates are mostly registered with events, but they can be used anywhere a function callback would traditionally be called for: for instance, LzTimerService.addTimer() takes a delegate as its argument.

You can create a delegate explicitly using the LzDelegate class, or implicitly by specifying an event handler. There are two syntaxes with which you can specify an event handler: in the open tag used to create that object, or by using the <handler> tag in the body of the object. -->
